Description:
"
  Stephan works with simple forms when constructing something, and he need 
  some programming tools to calculate his expenses. Let's take a trip back 
  to our school days and pull out some simple geometry for this.

  You should write a function to calculate the area of simple figures: circles, 
  rectangles and triangles. You are give an arbitrary number of arguments and 
  depending on this, the function calculates area for the different figures.
  
  One argument - The diameter of a circle and you need calculate the area of 
  the circle.
  Two arguments - The side lengths of a rectangle and you need calculate the 
  area of the rectangle.
  Three arguments - The lengths of each side on a triangle and you need calculate 
  the area of the triangle.
  
  The result should be given with two digits precision as ±0.01.
  
  Precondition:
  0 < len(args) ≤ 3
  all(0 < x ≤ 1000 for x in args)
  For "triangle" cases the sum of the lengths of any two sides always exceeds the 
  length of the third side.
