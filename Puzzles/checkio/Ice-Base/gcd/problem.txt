Description:
"
  The greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor of two or 
  more integers (at least one of which is not zero), is the largest positive integer that 
  divides a number without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
  
  You are given an arbitrary number of positive integers. You should find the greatest 
  common divisor for these numbers.
  
  Input: An arbitrary number of positive integers.
  
  Output: The greatest common divisor as an integer.
  
  Example:
  
  great_common_divisor(6, 4) == 2
  great_common_divisor(2, 4, 8) == 2
  
  How it is used: GCD is a basic concept found in mathematically oriented software. This 
  is a good example of a simple algorithm which has many possible applications.
  
  Precondition: 
  1 < len(args) ≤ 10
  all(0 < x ≤ 2 ** 32 for x in args)
